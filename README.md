# Cosmic Roads

I developed this project as a creative prototype a few years ago, crafting it for fun using Unreal Engine and leveraging assets from the Unreal Asset Store.

Tested on the Oculus Rift and PC, the project has its flaws but served as an opportunity to explore various interactions. Players can walk around environments, enter a car, and drive through these immersive worlds.

It turned out to be an exciting proof of concept for how spatial world exploration on wheels could look and function.
